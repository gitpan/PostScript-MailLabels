Revision history for Perl extension PostScript::MailLabels.

2.11 Sat Nov 13 14:42:37 CST 2004
	Put in a trap to catch empty fields and set them to blank with a
	warning (Joe Zacky found this one). Also update docs to explain the 
	barcode stuff, since if you look closely, it can be confusing.

2.10 Sun Aug 29 14:00:53 CDT 2004
	Added parameters for 5167 Avery (tm) stock - thanks to Daniel J McDonald
	for supplying the parameters.

	Also added many new Avery (tm) parameters. Thanks to Summer Misherghi
	who pointed me to http://www.worldlabel.com/Pages/pageaverylabels.htm

	Added new parameter set 'freetype', to allow the user to place a text 
	string anywhere they want. Particular use is for numbering the pages.

	Code now escapes special PostScript characters (){}[]<>/% in the
	input so that they will print properly and not crash the PS interpreter.

2.03 Fri Sep 28 07:26:27 CDT 2001
	Changed to honor user-defined number of columns - thanks to Allan 
	Engelhardt for supplying a patch.

2.02 Fri Jan 12 22:07:12 CST 2001
        Added y_gap tp Avery(tm) labels
        Updated calibration plot in BasicData to arbitrary paper size
        Minor repairs to test routine

2.00  Mon Jan  1 14:50:37 CST 2001
	Major revision. Added all of the component and label definition stuff. 
	Thanks to "Andrew Smith" <asmith at wpequity.com> for suggesting
	additional fields and inspiring the generalization.
	Thanks to Nuno Faria for assisting with the "Europeanization" of
	the code - it now works for Portuguese, and hopefully for other
	alphabets as well.
	Added pagesize so that various paper sizes are actually handled correctly.
	Minor bug fixes to PostScript::MailLabels::BasicData, now at version 1.01.
