Revision history for Perl extension PostScript::MailLabels.

2.24 Wed Jan  4 19:57:57 CST 2006
	Patch from Robert Harris to make output 7-bit clean

2.23 Tue Nov 29 20:55:38 CST 2005
	Added Avery 5526 labels per request of Wallace Winfrey

2.22 Sat Nov 26 14:25:39 CST 2005
	A small patch correcting the encoding for all fonts, with this patch you
	can use different fonts with IsoLatin encoding. Supplied by Ing. Juan 
	Manuel Calvo, Director del Centro de CÃ³mputos, Universidad del CEMA

2.21 Sat Aug 13 17:43:36 CDT 2005
	Minor repairs to fix what patches broke (ISOLatin1Encoding), update docs
		and examples.

2.20 Sat Aug 13 16:39:54 CDT 2005
	Applied patches from Jonathan Kamens
	1) Add support for No. 9 and No. 6 3/4 envelopes.

	2) Add 5160 to the list of Avery product codes for the layout code 5160
	   (since 5160 is the product code that appeared on the box of labels that
       I bought).

	3) Add a new "orientation" setup option which can be set to "portrait"
	   or "landscape", with "portrait" being the default.

	4) Modify the generated PostScript code so that if we're in landscape
	   mode, we rotate and translate appropriately.

	5) Wrap the generated PostScript code in "gsave ... grestore" so that
	   the translation and rotation is protected (this way, e.g., you can
	   have both a calibration page and a label test page in the same
	   PostScript file without over-rotating and over-translating).

	6) Don't hard-code the list of valid paper sizes in MailLabels.pm;
	   instead, get it from BasicData.pm.

	7) To support the new landscape stuff, add a new parameter to the
	   papersize() function, "logical", to indicate whether the caller
	   wants the physical page size or the logical one.  The logical page
	   size has the width and height flipped when in landscape mode.
	   Modify calls to papersize() when appropriate to use the logical
	   rather than physical page size.

	8) Fix a typo in a comment.

2.11 Sat Nov 13 14:42:37 CST 2004
	Put in a trap to catch empty fields and set them to blank with a
	warning (Joe Zacky found this one). Also update docs to explain the 
	barcode stuff, since if you look closely, it can be confusing.

2.10 Sun Aug 29 14:00:53 CDT 2004
	Added parameters for 5167 Avery (tm) stock - thanks to Daniel J McDonald
	for supplying the parameters.

	Also added many new Avery (tm) parameters. Thanks to Summer Misherghi
	who pointed me to http://www.worldlabel.com/Pages/pageaverylabels.htm

	Added new parameter set 'freetype', to allow the user to place a text 
	string anywhere they want. Particular use is for numbering the pages.

	Code now escapes special PostScript characters (){}[]<>/% in the
	input so that they will print properly and not crash the PS interpreter.

2.03 Fri Sep 28 07:26:27 CDT 2001
	Changed to honor user-defined number of columns - thanks to Allan 
	Engelhardt for supplying a patch.

2.02 Fri Jan 12 22:07:12 CST 2001
        Added y_gap tp Avery(tm) labels
        Updated calibration plot in BasicData to arbitrary paper size
        Minor repairs to test routine

2.00  Mon Jan  1 14:50:37 CST 2001
	Major revision. Added all of the component and label definition stuff. 
	Thanks to "Andrew Smith" <asmith at wpequity.com> for suggesting
	additional fields and inspiring the generalization.
	Thanks to Nuno Faria for assisting with the "Europeanization" of
	the code - it now works for Portuguese, and hopefully for other
	alphabets as well.
	Added pagesize so that various paper sizes are actually handled correctly.
	Minor bug fixes to PostScript::MailLabels::BasicData, now at version 1.01.
