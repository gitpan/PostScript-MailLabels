	Major revision. Added all of the component and label definition stuff. 
	Thanks to "Andrew Smith" <asmith at wpequity.com> for suggesting
	additional fields and inspiring the generalization.
	Thanks to Nuno Faria for assisting with the "Europeanization" of
	the code - it now works for Portuguese, and hopefully for other
	alphabets as well.
	Added pagesize so that various paper sizes are actually handled correctly.
	Minor bug fixes to PostScript::MailLabels::BasicData, now at version 1.01.
