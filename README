1. DESCRIPTION
--------------

This is a pair of modules for calibrating, testing, and printing mailing
labels on standard label stock.

The modules are :

PostScript::MailLabels
PostScript::MailLabels::BasicData

BasicData is called by MailLabels and is not meant to be called by anyone else.

MailLabels has three main outputs, in postscript(tm).

1. A calibration sheet for measuring the print borders and centering of your
   printer
2. A test sheet showing where the edges of the labels should be. This is used 
   to make the final adjustments to the calibration
3. The address labels themselves

Examples :



2. AVAILABILITY
---------------

  The newest version (which should be considered a beta version) is available
  through my home page:
    http://www.ajackson.org/software/maillabels
  Feel free to try it out.

  The current (non-beta) version of this module is available from your nearest
  CPAN site.

  The two will frequently be the same.

3. PREREQUISITES
----------------

Perl 5.005_03 is where I developed this. It may work with earlier versions,
but I haven't tried it. I'm not too sophisticated, so I'd be a little
surprised if I used anything not in 5.003 for example.

4. INSTALLATION
---------------

To install, just type
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

For help with Makefile.PL, try
perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker

If you wish to install in a non-standard place, use 

perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/lib PREFIX=~

5. RUNNING TESTS
----------------

The tests require ghostview be installed on your system, since the
tests primarily consist of creating Postscript(tm) documents and
piping them into ghostview for viewing.

I can't imagine the tests failing, unless you were missing some key part
of perl, but hey, things happen. If it fails, email me. Try running
make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 and send me the results.

6. DEMONSTRATION SCRIPTS
------------------------

In the /demo directory are some scripts that show what it can do. Hope they
make the documentation clearer.

Right now I'm using addressbook from http://home.pages.de/~clemens, which
is a reasonable ASCII database and Tcl/Tk front-end for editing the database.

7. BUGS
-------

None that I know of - when you find one, let me know.

If you do report it, please include :
- version of perl
- version of MailLabel
- Operating System and version
- description of problem
- a *short* piece of code that demonstrates the problem
